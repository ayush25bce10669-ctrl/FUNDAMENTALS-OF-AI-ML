# Project Statement

### Problem Statement



The project aims to predict future stock prices using historical data. Stock price prediction is a complex task due to market volatility and external factors. This project uses machine learning, specifically LSTM neural networks, to forecast future stock prices based on past trends.



### Scope of the Project



Fetch historical stock price data.



Preprocess data using normalization and windowing techniques.



Train an LSTM-based deep learning model.



Predict future prices and visualize performance.



Provide a reusable script for different stock tickers.



### Target Users



Data science students and researchers.



Stock market analysts.



Developers exploring time-series prediction.



Enthusiasts interested in ML-based financial forecasting.
